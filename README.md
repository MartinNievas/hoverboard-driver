# hoverboard-driver
ROS hardware driver for UART-controlled hoverboard. Can be used with [diff_drive_controller](http://wiki.ros.org/diff_drive_controller). Hoverboard is using [firmware by p-h-a-i-l and @btsimonh](https://github.com/bipropellant/bipropellant-hoverboard-firmware)

This driver is built for [Robaka](https://github.com/alex-makarov/robaka-ros), a prototyping robotic platform based on hoverboard, Jetson Nano and a bunch of sensors. There is a [Slack community](https://join.slack.com/t/robaka/shared_invite/zt-q52yfvnl-IP0h~JDOmgh3VmJ7Hh69Jw) for Robaka.

Clone with submodules:
```
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:alex-makarov/hoverboard-driver.git
